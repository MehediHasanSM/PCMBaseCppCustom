\arguments{
\item{model}{parameters of the JOU process. This must be a
named list with the following elements:
H: a k x k x R array, where R is the number of regimes of the
JOU process, k is the number of variables (traits), each H[,,r]
containing the matrix H for regime r;
Theta: a k x R matrix, row Theta[, r] containing the long-term
mean Theta for regime r;
Sigma: a k x k x R array, each Sigma[,,r] containing the
matrix Sigma for regime r;
Sigmae: a k x k x R array, each Sigmae[,,r] representing a diagonal matrix
with elements on the diagona corresponding to the environmental variances for
the k traits in regime r}

\item{pruneI}{an object of class QuadraticPolynomialJOU, which has been created using
PCMCppPruningObject.JOU.}
